# About udacity-course-projects
This is a repository containing some of the projects I did during my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. The projects were the following:

* **Project 1 - Simple SQL** was an introductory course consisting of a weather data download process using simple SQL queries and a time series analysis for that data.
* **Project 2 - Investigate a Dataset** involved an analysis of a dataset containing information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil with the goal of understanding what variables are correlated with not showing up to a medical appointment.
* **Project 3 - AB Tests and Regressions** contains A/B tests and regression analyses using the Statsmodels library with data from an e-commerce website. The goal was to understand if a new website page should be implemented or if keeping the old page would deliver the same statistical results.
* **Project 4 - Data Wrangling** was focused on the data processing steps of gathering, assessing, and cleaning data with Twitter data.
* **Project 5 - Data Visualisation** consisted of conducting exploratory and explanatory data visualisations using the Matplotlib and Seaborn librares with data from a bicycle sharing service in San Francisco.
